* remove out of range meshes
* load from file, store to file (pread, pwrite without lock because write only appends, lock only on defragment)
* make chunk 1D array, no need for CHUNK_SIZE.xyz
* queue failed world modifications
* loading from network
* cool world generator
* improve std::vector<cfg::Vertex> storage allocation strategy
* make cmake more portable
* wakeup worker when mesh or chunk updates are necessary, don't do sleep(100ms)
